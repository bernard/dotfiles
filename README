This is my own Unix dot files setup.

Works on any Unix flavor and is OSX compatible.

This environment was tweak by me and modified from different sources.

I would like to name those sources but as this was done more than a year ago, I don't actually
remember where they where all taken.

I'm sorry if you find some of your work here and I didn't give you any credit.

Please send me an email with your repo as to check and confirm your work.

I'll give you credit where it is found.

Thanks.
